# Action Server Monitor

This package provides an RQT Gui (based on [rqt_plot](https://github.com/ros-visualization/rqt_plot)) to visualize the status of running Action Servers.

## Prerequisites

This is an RQT plugin, so it requires RQT/ROS. To install additional dependencies you can use rosdep, e.g.:

```bash
rosdep install --from-paths action_server_monitor/
```
